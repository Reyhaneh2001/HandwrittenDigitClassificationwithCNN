This project demonstrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for handwritten digit classification using the sklearn digits dataset. The goal is to build a simple yet effective image classification model leveraging TensorFlow/Keras.

It also features rich visualizations, including accuracy and loss curves, confusion matrix heatmaps, per-class performance charts, and a grid of incorrect predictions, all designed to enhance the interpretability and presentation of the modelâ€™s performance.
